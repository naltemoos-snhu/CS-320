How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
We can ensure that our projects stay functional by continuous testing in the form of unit, system, and integration testing, that the program still fulfills the requirements from our requirement analysis. We can also have feedback from users to make sure that the functionality meets their expectations at multiple stages of development. We make sure our projects are secure in various ways on top of maintaining funcitonality. The main methods are regular code reviews and updates along with pen testing.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
We can interpret user needs by using various means of communication such as interviews and surveys with the client and users to gather requirements. From there we can create user personas to help frame our tests and the goals of the users as well as have continuous communication with iterative feedback with betas. We then incoraprate these needs to create measurable requirements from the needs of the users and give our personas stories to help give context to the requirements.

How do I approach designing software?
I approach designing software by keeping in mind the key principles of modularity, reusability, and scalabilty. Modularity helps with keeping everything organized and testing. By making code that can be reused it saves time down the line when oyu can refer back to something you already figured out, same with using simple and common structures. Scalabilty is important because if you design code thats pigeon holed and need to be completely reworked later it creates technical debt and it's essentially doing the same task twice.
